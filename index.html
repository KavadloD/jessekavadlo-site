                    <h3>Rock of Pages: The Literary Tradition of 1980s Heavy Metal</h3>
                </header>
                <div class="book-body">
                    <p>Rock of Pages provides contexts and close readings of 1980s heavy metal with forty years of
                        hindsight, drawing upon
                        analytical frameworks usually associated with literature and literary studies.</p>
                    <p>Based on decades of work as a professor of literature and as a musician, Jesse Kavadlo analyzes
                        the ways in which 1980s
                        heavy metal aligns with and develops many of the themes prevalent in the canon of literature. In
                        doing so, the book
                        examines some of the contexts of 1980s heavy metal, including Cold War, the rise of MTV, and the
                        formation of the
                        Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC) and subsequent congressional hearings.</p>
                    <p>Rock of Pages takes the PMRC's own objections to heavy metal and uses them as titles and topics
                        to analyze the
                        intersections between heavy metal and literature: representations of violence, but the connected
                        concerns about justice;
                        images of substance abuse, and the interrelated issues of obsession, madness, suicidal ideation;
                        sex and love, with,
                        concomitantly, representations of women and relationships between men and women; and the
                        references to the occult, with
                        the depictions of Satan, the afterlife, and morality on earth itself. In doing so, the book
                        suggests that 1980s heavy
                        metal displayed more artistry and intelligence than people imagine, but that literature is
                        rebellious and subversive as
                        well.</p>

                <div class="book-body">
                    <p>Don DeLillo is one of the most important novelists of the late twentieth and early twenty-first
                        century. Yet despite
                        DeLillo's prolific output and scholarly recognition, much of the attention has gone to his works
                        individually, rather
                        than collectively or thematically. This volume provides separate entries into the wide variety
                        and categories of
                        contexts that surround and help illuminate DeLillo's writings. Don DeLillo in Context examines
                        how geography, biography,
                        history, media studies, culture, philosophy, and the writing process provide critical frameworks
                        and ways of reading and
                        understanding DeLillo's prodigious body of work.</p>

                        the history of the late
                        twentieth and early twenty-first centuries in novels such as The Mysteries of Pittsburgh (1988),
                        Wonder Boys (1995), and
                        Telegraph Avenue (2012). The Pulitzer Prize–winning author of The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier
                        and Clay, Chabon
                        follows in the footsteps of past stylists, writing across multiple genres that include
                        young-adult literature, essays,
                        and screenplays. Despite his broad success, however, Chabon’s work has not been adequately
                        examined from a critical
                        perspective.</p>
                    <p>Michael Chabon’s America: Magical Words, Secret Worlds, and Sacred Spaces is the first scholarly
                        collection of essays
                        analyzing the work of the acclaimed author. This book demonstrates how Chabon uses a broad range
                        of styles and genres,
                        including detective and comic book fiction, to define the American experience. These essays
                        assess and analyze Chabon’s
                        complete oeuvre, demonstrating his deep connection to the contemporary world and his place as a
                        literary force.</p>
                    <p>Providing a context for understanding the author’s work from cultural, historical, and stylistic
                        perspectives, Michael
                        Chabon’s America is a valuable study of a celebrated author whose work deserves close
                        examination.</p>

                <div class="book-body">
                    <p>Don DeLillo – winner of the National Book Award, the William Dean Howells Medal, and the
                        Jerusalem Prize – is one of the
                        most important novelists of the late-twentieth and early-twenty-first centuries. While his work
                        can be understood and
                        taught as prescient and postmodern examples of millennial culture, this book argues that
                        DeLillo’s recent novels – White
                        Noise, Libra, Mao II, Underworld, and The Body Artist – are more concerned with spiritual
                        crisis. Although DeLillo’s
                        worlds are rife with rejection of belief and littered with faithfulness, estrangement, and
                        desperation, his novels
                        provide a balancing moral corrective against the conditions they describe. Speaking the
                        vernacular of contemporary
                        America, DeLillo explores the mysteries of what it means to be human.</p>
